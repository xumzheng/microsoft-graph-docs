# call: keepAlive

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Make a request to this API every 15 to 45 minutes to ensure that an ongoing call remains active. A call that does not receive this request within 45 minutes is considered inactive and will subsequently end.

At least one successful request must be made within 45 minutes of the previous request, or the start of the call.

We recommend that you send a request in shorter time intervals (every 15 minutes). Make sure that these requests are successful to prevent the call from timing out and ending.

Attempting to send a request to a call that has already ended will result in a `404 Not-Found` error. The resources related to the call should be cleaned up on the application side.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions may be required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not Supported        |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported        |
| Application     | Calls.Initiate.All, Calls.AccessMedia.All |

> **Note:** Permissions are checked when the call is created; no additional permission check is made when calling this API. Calls.AccessMedia.All is only necessary for calls that use app-hosted media.
