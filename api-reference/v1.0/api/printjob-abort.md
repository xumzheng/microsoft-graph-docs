# printJob: abort

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Abort a print job. Only applications using application permissions can abort a print job.

Aborting a print job will only succeed if there is a [printTask](../resources/printTask.md) in a `processing` state on the associated print job, started by a trigger that the requesting app created. For details about how to register a task trigger, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

In addition to the following permissions, the app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription and have either the Printer.Read.All or Printer.ReadWrite.All application permission.
