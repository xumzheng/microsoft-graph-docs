# List methods

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of authentication methods registered to a user. The authentication methods are defined by the types derived from the [authenticationMethod](../resources/authenticationmethod.md) resource type, and only the methods supported on this API version. See [Azure AD authentication methods API overview](../resources/authenticationmethods-overview.md) for a list of currently supported methods.

## Permissions

The following tables show the least privileged permission or permissions required to call this API on each supported resource type. Follow [best practices](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions) to request least privileged permissions. For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).
