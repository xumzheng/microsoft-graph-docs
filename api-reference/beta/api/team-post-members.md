# Add member to team
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Add a new [conversation member](../resources/conversationmember.md) to a [team](../resources/team.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> The **roles** property will be empty by default for all members. This property only contains additional qualifiers when relevant - for example, if the member has `owner` privileges, the roles property contains `owner` as one of the values. Similarly, if the member is a guest, the **roles** property contains `guest` as one of the values. A basic member should not have any values specified in the **roles** property.
