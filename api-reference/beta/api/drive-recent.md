## Remarks

Some driveItems returned from the **recent** action will include the **remoteItem** facet which indicates they are items from another drive. 
To access the original driveItem object, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "drives-get-remoteitem" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{remoteItem-driveId}/items/{remoteItem-id}
```
